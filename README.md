# Node GraphQL Prototyping Example

GraphQL beign a relatively fast prototyping platform, I set out to build a prototyping boiler plate for me and for others to use. Specially through the easy mocking nature of GraphQL's type system. To get started with GraphQL, I recommend [HOW TO GRAPHQL.](https://www.howtographql.com)

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) Prefered

## Getting Started

1. `git clone ` + repo URL
2. cd to repo
3. `yarn` - installing node packages
4. `yarn run json-server` - start json server
5. `yarn run dev-server` - start node application in dev mode 

## History

1. Initial API prototyping example 
2. Added ESLINT Airbnb style guide 

## Built With

* [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
* [JSON Server](http://www.numpy.org) - Simulate a backend server and a REST API with a simple JSON file

## Contributing

1. Fork it! Star it?
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
